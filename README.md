Introduction
-
We are working for a building leasing and marketing company, and have been tasked with researching the Commercial Building Disclosure project, which can benefit from data visualisation. 
Searchable with data, you can view a map as well as specific building metrics such as ratings, energy intensity, net lettable areas and more.
The data delivery is manual to up-date and requires processing to make easy to understand, this clearly shows the certified buildings and their ratings in an easy and visual way.

Background
-
A National Energy Efficiency Program
The Commercial Building Disclosure (CBD) Program is a national regulatory program that requires energy efficiency information to be provided in most cases when commercial office space of 1000 square metres or more is offered for sale or lease.

Purpose
-
The primary objective of this project is to perform a visualisation analysis of up to 40,000 ratings within Victoria using available data from the Australian Government site www.cbd.gov.au.

Ethics
-
The CBD Program is an example of transparency in data collection. This is an instance where you would want the data that has been collected to be shared. The data provided to clients allows them to make an informed choice regarding the energy efficiency of the building they would like to lease which could ultimately affect their fixed costs.
